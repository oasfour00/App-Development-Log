# App-Development-Log

Hello!

My name is Omar Asfour, and I am a graduate in International Business with a newly discovered passion for data analysis, and coding in general. I recently decided to challenge myself by diving into a new project headfirst and hopefully emerge more knowledgable on the other side with a working project.

We have a few main ideas for this app that we plan to realize or shed off depending on how realistic and useful they would be to implement. 


Our target market for this app will be members of the public who are beginner to intermediate gym-goers who are not seeing results when it comes to their bodies. Our main goal for this app is to gather user's weekly gym schedule, and then return a checklist format of the workouts that the user could perform to achieve constant progressive overload. In addition to this, we were thinking of implementing the ChatGPT API to reccomend meal plans, alternate workouts, and more.
