# App-Development-Log

Hello!

My name is Omar Asfour, and I am a graduate in International Business with a newly discovered passion for data analysis, and coding in general. I recently decided to challenge myself by diving into a new project headfirst and hopefully emerge more knowledgable on the other side with a working project.

#Enter Kenz's Intro Paragraph

We have a few main ideas for this app that we plan to realize or shed off depending on how realistic and useful they would be to implement. 

Our target userbase for this app will be younger members of the public who are beginner to intermediate gym-goers and are not seeing results when it comes to their bodies. Our main goal for this app is to gather user's weekly gym schedule, and then return a checklist format of the workouts that the user could perform to achieve constant progressive overload. In addition to this, we were thinking of implementing the ChatGPT API to reccomend meal plans, alternate workouts, and more based on the inputted user information. We also have ideas for social media aspects, where users can share their completed workouts with friends, and maybe implementing a points or streak based system (kind of like SnapChat) which rewards the user with points based on completing challenges on a daily or weekly streak.

This is our first time creating an app, so we are expecting to face a lot of challenges along the way. While I am pretty proficient in Python, I didn't go to school for Computer Science, and I have no experience in UI/UX design, much less creating an entire application from scratch. Nevertheless, I always found my biggest learning moments came from throwing myself off the deep end and fixing mistakes along the way, which is why I decided to bite the bullet and just go for it regarding this app.

This app will be written in Python. Kivy will be used for the UI elements, MongoDB for database and storage of user information, and possibly Django/Flask for web applications. The great thing is that I dont know any of these frameworks, so I truly am starting from as close to scratch as you can possibly get. Future devlogs will walk readers through the my process of learning all these things, then using htme to build the app.

Thanks for reading, and check back for updates!
